  "body": "### Welcome to DUGreen Project Pages.\r\n\r\nGreenC5 is a prototype of an adaptive and energy-aware version of the traditional [C5 Generic Collection](https://www.itu.dk/research/c5/)â€”A well-known comprehensive and open-source data structure library for .NET programming.\r\n\r\nThe main features of our GreenC5:\r\n\r\n1. GreenC5 can select and transform to different C5 data structures automatically and dynamically at runtime, for energy efficiency.\r\n2. GreenC5 is smart, adaptive, energy-aware and lightweight. The overhead is less than 3%.\r\n3. GreenC5 is easy-to-use because the usage is similar to traditional data structures. Programmers do not need to select a data structure. Only one declaration is needed for each instance of the data structures. There is also minimal extra installations and configurations to use GreenC5.\r\n\r\n### The released projects include:\r\n\r\n1. **Watts Up? Framework:** this framework contains APIs for power measurement using a Watts Up? Pro meter.\r\n2. **Intel Power Gadget Framework:** this framework contains APIs for power measurement using the Intel Power Gadget with other required libraries.\r\n3. **CRUD-Based Collection Energy Profiling:** this project contains a program for creating training and program validation datasets using a Watts Up? Pro power meter.\r\n4. **Machine Learning Framework:** this project contains two implementations of an Artificial Neural Network and N-Gram.\r\n5. **CRUD-Based C5 Collection:** this project contains a wrapper/factory class of the C5 data structures.\r\n6. **Green CRUD-Based C5 Collection:** this project contains the GreenC5 data structure class, Green component and other utility classes.\r\n7. **GreenC5 Simulator:** this project is the implementation of our GreenC5 simulator to allow users to interact with the GreenC5 in different use-case scenarios and settings. The project also contains code examples of the GreenC5 is used; experiment and evaluation projects of the three additional case studies; and the implementations of Watts Up? and Intel Power Gadget based power profilers. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nJunya Michanan (@michanaj), Computer Science Department, University of Denver, Colorado, USA.\r\n\r\nMore information please read our research paper(s):\r\n\r\n1.
